\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The CoT-SelfEvolve model, leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, shows improved performance in handling Pytorch, Sklearn, and Matplotlib questions over the original SelfEvolve model.

        \item The ablation study verifies the significant role of CoT prompt generators in enhancing the model's performance, with a substantial relative gain of \textbf{16.39\%}.

        \item The potential of employing a larger LLM for guiding the code generation process is demonstrated, resulting in a significant performance increase, marked by a relative gain of \textbf{11.26\%}.
