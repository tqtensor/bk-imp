== Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a robust forecasting model to predict the demand for taxi trips in New York City (NYC). By leveraging time series analysis techniques and incorporating additional data, such as weather information, we aim to enhance the accuracy of the predictions and gain insights into the factors influencing taxi trip demand.

In addition to predicting the demand for taxi trips in NYC, this project also has the broader objective of utilizing the forecasted demand for dynamic pricing purposes. Dynamic pricing refers to the practice of adjusting prices based on real-time demand and supply conditions. By incorporating the forecasted demand into the dynamic pricing strategy, taxi service providers can optimize their pricing decisions, maximize revenue, and efficiently allocate their resources.

However, given the time constraints of the project, the focus will primarily be on developing a robust forecasting model to predict taxi trip demand accurately. This will lay the foundation for the subsequent phase of implementing dynamic pricing strategies.

By forecasting demand accurately and gaining insights into the factors influencing demand, this project sets the stage for the future implementation of dynamic pricing, which has the potential to enhance the efficiency, profitability, and overall customer experience in the taxi industry.
